# CalculadoraWeb
Simple calculator programmed with web technologies.

I am developing this calculator in order to practice and improve my skills with web technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript and framework Bootstrap. 
The calculator has its basic functions: sum, rest, multiplication, division, and result. Beside, it has a reset function and maybe I will add more when it's finished.
